Alicia Chang, Associated-Press science writer:  <blockquote> Five months after the Fukushima disaster, <a href="https://thehawaiiindependent.com/hugo/\&quot;http://www.somas.stonybrook.edu/people/fisher.html\&quot;">[Nicholas] Fisher</a> of Stony Brook University in New York and a team decided to test Pacific bluefin that were caught off the coast of San Diego. To their surprise, tissue samples from all 15 tuna captured contained levels of two radioactive substances — ceisum-134 and cesium-137 — that were higher than in previous catches. </blockquote>  Prof. Fisher: \"That's a big ocean. To swim across it and still retain these radionuclides is pretty amazing.
