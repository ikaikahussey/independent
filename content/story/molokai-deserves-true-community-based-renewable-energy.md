[The Molokai Dispatch](https://themolokaidispatch.com) has posted a letter from Molokai Renewable Energy Cooperative leaders, speaking out on the news that Hawaiian Electric will be submitting it's own competing bid for Molokai's upcoming Community Based Renewable Energy RFP:

> At this point, the choice of project awardee will be determined by Hawaiian Electricâ€™s RFP team, which means that Hawaiian Electric itself will be the one deciding whether to award the contract to their own company or to another bidder, such as our community-based cooperative. It seems that no matter how objective the RFP team tries to be, it is a fundamentally unfair competition.
