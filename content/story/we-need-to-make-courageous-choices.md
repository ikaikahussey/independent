We need to make courageous choices

Kim Coco Iwamoto

Unprecedented. We hear that word a lot right now. Indeed, unprecedented times offer extraordinary opportunities. The intense changes we are experiencing together as a result of COVID-19 are similar to the tumultuous metamorphosis a caterpillar undergoes. What a waste it would be if, after all that radical cellular recomposition, the caterpillar emerged only as a caterpillar of another color, failing to ever take flight as a butterfly.

We need a transformation. For too long we have underinvested in our people and our aina, which are our most cherished core assets. As our state legislature reconvenes into its final weeks of session, we are asking lawmakers to not squander this time and opportunity by simply reinforcing the failed status quo. We are looking for courageous leaders that will champion a new general plan for the islands which swiftly prioritizes our core assets, and provides the foundation for new economic value created locally.

This plan should include:

1) An increased emphasis on agriculture ($80M reallocation, +1,600 new jobs). The Hawaiʻi Tourism Authority has $80M a year to promote a product that sells itself. We need to redirect that investment to conservation, agricultural production and value-added food industries. Hawaiʻi has the ideal conditions for producing food, and our natural environment is cited as the primary reason tourists visit, yet both are historically undervalued. A reallocation of the tourism promotion budget could be used to jumpstart a civilian conservation corps program in the uplands as well as farming and aquaculture programs along the plains and makai areas. As tourism reopens at a more appropriate level, we have to make sure that workers’ health and safety are kept front and center.

2) A universal child care pilot program, ($73.7M CARES funds, +1,473 jobs). As a working mom, I understand the need for quality child care. Parents across Hawaii depend on this critical service and they can’t return to work without it. Even before the pandemic, an incredible 64% of Hawaii’s 109,000 keiki needed child care ([2017 study](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/goodbeginnings/pages/197/attachments/original/1513810619/Hawaii_Early_Learning_Needs_Assessment_-_Summary_Report_WEB.pdf?1513810619)). The $73.7M I’m calling for would meet one-fifth of this demand while creating 1,473 jobs (assuming a living wage of[ $24.80/hour](https://humanservices.hawaii.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/4.13.20-Final-Cover-D2-Feminist-Economic-Recovery-D1.pdf)). The new jobs created by a publicly funded child and elder care program would bring cascading benefits; it would immediately reduce stress on the unemployment system, allow for unpaid caregivers to expand their work availability outside the home, increase gross economic productivity, and ultimately bolster public tax revenues.  
 3) A pilot program for universal health care. ($75M CARES, 50,000 residents served). Several hundred thousand workers are at risk of losing their health insurance because of job loss, and thousands of employers are struggling to maintain coverage for the workers they are retaining. [The Working Families Coalition is recommending](https://www.workingfamilieshawaii.org/cares-act-priorities) that the state create a temporary subsidy using CARES monies to address this gap. I second their proposal, and support expanding it into a state-sponsored health program using a progressive tax. Decoupling employment and health insurance removes a significant financial burden on small businesses and nonprofits, while providing more certainty for vulnerable employees.

4) Prioritization of climate-ready infrastructure projects ($1B state bond issuance). The state is rightly considering a series of shovel-ready projects, but the list being considered by the state house is too broad. I recommend prioritizing projects that will prepare Hawaiʻi for a climate-changed future. This includes investing in the relocation of major public infrastructure at risk from sea level rise, advancing state-of-the-art clean energy projects, electrical and sewer upgrades, and new workforce housing along with clean transportation infrastructure. In our current low-interest-rate environment, it makes sense to use bonds to pay for critical infrastructure.

We are at a pivot point in the history of our islands. I hope that our legislators will have the courage to take us in the right direction.
