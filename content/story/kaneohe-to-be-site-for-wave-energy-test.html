A device that will potentially turn wave energy into electricity will be put into Kaneohe waters by the end of 2012. The design was developed by <a href="https://thehawaiiindependent.com/hugo/\&quot;http://www.nwenergyinnovations.com/\&quot;">Northwest Energy Innovations</a>, a New Zealand company, and will be placed in the bay to collect data for about a year. The spot in which the device will be placed is a U.S Navy Wave Energy Test Site.
