<p>Bringing closure to a <a href="../story/verbatim-house-democrats-call-for-a-change-in-leadership-in-letter-to-speak.html">month-long</a> leadership impasse, Calvin Say retained his control over the State House today. Committees will likely be announced tomorrow, which will shed light on what compromise (if any) was reached between dissident Democrats, the Republican minority, and the mainstream Democrats. </p>

<p>The question: are you satisfied with Rep. Say staying on as Speaker? Or were you siding with the dissidents? We&#8217;d love to hear from you in the comments.</p>
